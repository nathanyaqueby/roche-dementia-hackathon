# DigiMemoir ðŸ‘µðŸ‘´ðŸ§“
Our mission is simple: to help people with dementia remember daily objects and their loved ones. Our POC takes pictures of objects & people and stores the stories associated with them. Whenever the person focuses on an object or person, the digital memory will start talking about it, reminding the person of the history behind that object or person.

Developed during the Roche Dementia Hackathon Challenge by Team 4 (Women in AI and Robotics).
